            <p>Small Brain is a web based clinical information system.&nbsp; It's a radically different model than first
                generation EHRs.&nbsp; Our system has been designed to handle complex patients while capturing the most
                objective data generated during the encounter, all the while reducing time charting.</p>
            <p>We have worked with leading information scientists and physicians to create something
                revolutionary.&nbsp;
                Check it out for yourself, it's an open source project so if you have the skills we will help you get
                started.&nbsp; If you need us to do all the tech work we can make that happen too.</p>

            <p>Like all great stories it started around a fire.&nbsp; Kevin Perdue and James Ryan were reflecting on the
                strange state of clinical informations systems and soon began to dream of making something truly cool.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We began by getting help.&nbsp; One of our earliest advisors was Charles Friedman who became our
                Gandalf, and without his caring support would not have been brave enough to leave the Shire.&nbsp;

            <p>Small brain records is a problem, task, encounter based system.&nbsp; Its goal is to allow complex
                patients
                to be managed safely while ensuring that the data collected during clinical care is accurate and
                objective.</p>

            <p>The system is web based and allows patients and their care team to collaboratively manage their
                health.&nbsp;
                Problems can be accessed by patients and physicians, and notes, images, orders and other relevant data
                can
                be added or reviewed by both user types.</p>
            <p>Tasks are also collaborative, allowing patients and their care team to manage the Todo list, and each
                Todo provides a space for task specific communication.&nbsp; The system automatically connects the task
                with
                the relevant clinical problem, and any clinical encounters it is referenced in.</p>
            <p>Encounters are audio recorded, compressed and uploaded all in the browser.&nbsp; The system automatically
                annotates the audio recording linking the appropriate parts of the encounter to each relevant problem
                and
                task.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="nonblock" href="https://vimeo.com/user35042652" target="_blank">Here

            <p>The system has been built to learn how I practice medicine, how I heal, how I recommend, how I use the
                system
                itself.&nbsp; The the set of actions we as physicians undertakes to care for patients is finite and
                categorical.&nbsp; We started with a simple ontology for our prototype, and since then have continued to
                add
                and sub-categorize.&nbsp; This data set informs the system how I work, both in the context of a
                particular
                patient, but also in the context of a particular clinical problem and task. With continued use the
                system
                can predict what I will do next as I navigate through it, and so the buttons I click today are teaching
                the
                system how to follow and predict me autonomously.&nbsp; This is what you want as a unique clinician.</p>
            <p>By starting with the most elemental model of healing we ensure that changes in technology will not
                disturb the evolution of the system.&nbsp; We tested our model against every recorded instance of the
                healing act on the planet.&nbsp; You can drop this puppy into the hands of a tech happy shaman in the
                wild
                and they will find it as helpful as an urban internal medicine physician.</p>

            <p>Patient's and their care givers have never had such deep access and privileges to collaborate in their
                health
                records.&nbsp; As Glynn Elwin said &quot;it's like Open Notes on steroids&quot;.&nbsp; Patients can log
                in
                and add problems, add notes to current problems that become part of the legal document, add images, data
                points and even data types.&nbsp; Tasks, orders, referrals etc. can be discussed in a meaningful way
                that
                retains the clinical context. Patients can grant access to family members or other individuals that they
                trust to help them on the health journey.&nbsp; Encounters are audio recorded and easy to access on most
                modern devices.&nbsp; Particular discussions can quickly be found in the appropriate problem and easily
                tagged for quick access.&nbsp; We see our system as the logical conclusion of a patient portal ie. one
                unified system that enables deep collaboration. Have a <a class="nonblock"
